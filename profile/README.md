## **Rules & Guidelines**

To maintain a respectful, fair, and immersive atmosphere, **all players** must observe the following:

1. **Respect Others**  
   - No harassment, bullying, or discrimination. Treat others in a civil manner both in and out of character.

2. **Roleplay Integrity**  
   - Stay in character whenever possible and avoid actions that break immersion (e.g., “Powergaming” or “Metagaming”).
   - Use appropriate channels (in-game, Discord, etc.) for Out-of-Character (OOC) discussions.

3. **Fair Play & No Exploits**  
   - Cheating, hacking, or exploiting game bugs to gain an unfair advantage is strictly prohibited.

4. **Follow Server Staff Directions**  
   - If a staff member requests your cooperation or instructs you to pause an action, comply immediately.
   - Issues can be discussed or appealed later if necessary.

5. **Respect the Server Economy**  
   - Avoid unrealistic transactions or attempts to manipulate in-game systems.

> **Violation of these rules** may result in warnings, suspensions, or permanent bans depending on severity and frequency.
